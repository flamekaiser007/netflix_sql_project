It aims to extract meaningful insights about global content trends, genre distribution, release patterns, and actor appearances. The analysis includes data cleaning, content categorization, and aggregation using advanced SQL queries such as window functions, CASE statements, and string operations. This project serves as a portfolio demonstration of SQL proficiency for real-world data analytics.
